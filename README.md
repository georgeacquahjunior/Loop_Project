## 🟢 Easy Projects

### 1. Multiplication Table Generator
- **Goal:** Take a number as input and display its multiplication table (1 to 10).
- **Success Criteria:** Outputs correctly formatted results (`5 x 1 = 5`, ..., `5 x 10 = 50`).
- **Stretch Goal:** Allow user to set custom range.

---

### 2. Number Guessing Game (Limited Tries)
- **Goal:** Generate a random number and let the user guess it within a limited number of attempts.
- **Success Criteria:** Loop exits when user guesses correctly or attempts run out.
- **Stretch Goal:** Provide “too high” or “too low” hints.

---

### 3. Countdown Timer
- **Goal:** Ask for a number and count down to 0 with a 1-second delay.
- **Success Criteria:** Countdown prints properly with pauses.
- **Stretch Goal:** Print “Time’s up!” or play a sound at the end.

---

### 4. List Reversal Without Built-in Functions
- **Goal:** Reverse a list using loops only.
- **Success Criteria:** Reversed list prints correctly.
- **Stretch Goal:** Write it as a reusable function `my_reverse(lst)`.

## 🟡 Intermediate Projects

### 5. Simple Pattern Printer
- **Goal:** Print a triangle pattern of `*` using loops.
- **Success Criteria:** Number of rows is user-defined; pattern prints correctly.
- **Stretch Goal:** Add inverted and pyramid pattern options.

---

### 6. Find Prime Numbers in a Range
- **Goal:** Input start and end numbers, print all primes in that range.
- **Success Criteria:** All primes are printed correctly using loop logic.
- **Stretch Goal:** Count and display how many primes found.

---

### 7. Basic Password Strength Checker
- **Goal:** Analyze a password’s strength based on content.
- **Success Criteria:** Reports password as weak, medium, or strong using loops to inspect characters.
- **Stretch Goal:** Suggest how to make weak passwords stronger.

---

### 8. Text-Based Menu System
- **Goal:** Implement a console menu system with a loop (e.g. Calculator, Info Viewer).
- **Success Criteria:** Menu keeps looping until user selects “Exit”.
- **Stretch Goal:** Add error handling for invalid choices.

## 🔴 Challenging Projects

### 9. FizzBuzz with a Twist
- **Goal:** Print numbers 1–100, replacing:
  - Multiples of 3 → "Fizz"
  - Multiples of 5 → "Buzz"
  - Multiples of 7 → "Pop"
- **Success Criteria:** Loop correctly prints with conditions.
- **Stretch Goal:** Let user define numbers and labels.

---

### 10. Mini Snake Game (Console Version)
- **Goal:** Simulate a simple snake game on a grid using loops and `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys.
- **Success Criteria:** Snake moves within bounds; game ends on wall collision.
- **Stretch Goal:** Add randomly placed food and increase snake length on eat.
